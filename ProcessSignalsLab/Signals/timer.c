/*
Copy your current signals.c to a new program timer.c such that after exiting (via CTRL-C), will print out the total time the program was executing in seconds. 
To accomplish this task, you will need to register a second signal handler for the SIGINT signal, the signal that is delivered when CTRL-C is pressed. 
Conceptually, your program will request a SIGALRM signal to occur every second, 
tracking the number of alarms delivered, and when the program exits via CTRL-C, 
it will print how many alarms occurred, and the number of seconds it was executed.
