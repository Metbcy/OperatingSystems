/*
Creating two child process from 1 parent
Both child processes will loop for some random number of iterations but no more than 30x.
Parent process will wait for both child processes to finish

Inside the loop:
Each child should print the message "Child PId:<pid> is going to sleep" then call the sleep() method
Sleeps for a random number of seconds but no more than 10 second
When child awakes it should print the message  “Child Pid: is awake!\nWhere is my Parent: <ppid>?”.
use getpid() to obtain the <pip> of the running process
use getppid() to obtain the <ppid> of the parent
After the loop is over, each child should print the message "Child PId:<pid> is exiting" and call exist method


For the Parent Process:
parent process must call the wait function to wait for the child processes to finish
parent process should print the message "Child Pid: <pid> has completed" using the wait(&status)
